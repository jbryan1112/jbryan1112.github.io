React is a Javascript library, maintained by Facebook, for building user interfaces. React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

React's modular approach to programming allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state. This means react code is extremely portable.

React allows you to pass data via props, allowing developers to reuse code where possible.
